*Welcome, web-surfer!*

I'm Philipp — a technologist by trade and a lifelong learner by nature. While I work in tech, my interests extend well beyond the digital.

Currently I am working on becoming more mindful of my technology usage, and develop a better understanding of what role technology should have in my life.

This site is where I share ideas, insights, and explorations across the topics that intrest me. Whether technical or philosophical, each post reflects my desire to better understand the world — and my place in it.

If you'd like, you can contact me at [&#112;&#104;&#105;&#108;&#105;&#112;&#112;&#64;&#107;&#117;&#108;&#108;&#98;&#97;&#99;&#104;&#46;&#110;&#101;&#116;](mailto:&#112;&#104;&#105;&#108;&#105;&#112;&#112;&#64;&#107;&#117;&#108;&#108;&#98;&#97;&#99;&#104;&#46;&#110;&#101;&#116;)

Thanks for reading.
