This is the first post on my new website.

I’ve tried maintaning a personal website a few times in the past. Sadly I always was frustrated with it, because I thought it did not look *professional* oder *polished* enough.

So I set out to create the simplest possible site — putting the content first. This site runs on a custom Hugo template I built with minimal CSS and only one line of JS for the mobile menu. The simplicity is intentional. I want this site to be a place where I can focus on the content.
