This is the first post on my new website.

I’ve tried maintaning a personal website a few times in the past. I always became frustrated with it, because I thought it did not look *professional* oder *polished* enough.

So I set out to create the simplest possible site — putting the content first.

This site is build with Hugo and a custom template I made. It has minimal CSS and only one line of JS for the mobile menu. The simplicity is intentional. I want this site to be a place where I can focus on the content.
